      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been analyzing the data for a while with my friend 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cleidson_alves&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cleidson&lt;/a&gt; and we always asked ourselves, how to determine the optimal number of clusters for our data? I think this is one of the main questions when working with single-cell data. Although some better known tools like Seurat (R) and Scanpy (Python) have different methods of clustering, they do not return the optimal number of clusters. What I had been doing previously was generating different resolutions with the data and checking with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lazappi/clustree&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;clustree&lt;/a&gt; package in R how the clusters were split from the smallest to the maximum resolution that I had predetermined.&lt;/p&gt;
